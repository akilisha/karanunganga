# The Proposition

Hi family. I wanted to kickstart a candid conversation around what our collective objectives and collective responsibilities are in this group, beyond celebrating that we all share the same family tree. Don't get me wrong, I'm not diminishing the value of our family tree - it's absolutely priceless and worth celebrating. What I'm trying to ignite instead is a dialog about how as a group we can move beyond just being basic to being a resourceful group and even pushing bigger agendas. Allow me to elaborate.

To begin with, I wish to acknowledge that our family tree spans multiple generations, which means that the age gap is definitely very wide. For this conversation, I'm hoping to reach the group between 30 and 50 years, give or take. I think it is this age group that is best positioned to understand the gravity of this conversation. For the rest, it is perfectly fine to follow along and feel free chime in and shed some additional perspectives.

I will make my pitch now. For the entirety of our lives growing up, our parents seemed to have had this blueprint that they used to teach us how to navigate the world around us and hopefully find success. The blueprint was pretty basic and minimalist - go to school, score spectacular grades, focus only on sciences, and then you will get a job. That was it, and there was not much more to it, in terms of navigating life beyond the point of landing a job. They did the best they knew how to, and we cannot fault them for not knowing any better. There was no counsel, for example, around how to make wise or sound financial decisions like investing or even more importantly, securing the financial stability of our children, the future generation, by making strategic investments on their behalf. Our parents, or at least the majority of them, were simply not equipped with this kind of information or knowledge. Unfortunately, and respectfully so, our parents may also have perceived us, as their insurance policy to take care of them during their old age. So when we were growing up, if we deviated from this blueprint, we were not well equipped to deal with anything that life would throw at us. Life just took a nasty detour and people were left to navigate it through any means they thought would work out. For those whom the blueprint worked out, their success may have inadvertently reinforced the notion that our parents' blueprint was the only sure way of finding success. As a result, each successive generation has been replaying the same blueprint, repeating the same mistakes and reinforcing the same wrong notions upon the next generation, and it has become this vicious cycle that we can all see is the cycle of doom, but which we do not know where the eject button is to escape the cycle. I'm hoping to turn these notions upside down through initiating an open conversation.


We are a diverse group, distributed fairly widely within the country, with different talents, varying degrees of capabilities, and other hidden superpowers. I'm sure that if we harnessed all this potential together in a well-planned and synchronized manner, then we should be able to start a new trend. I'm not sure if you know about this, but some communities (for example wahria or wayahudi) will give preference to doing business with one another before they can outsource the business outside their group? When it comes to loans, for example, they will lend to each other without charging interest, but they will charge interest to people outside the group? They will work together to build houses for people in their community instead of hiring external labor? I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this. They take advantage of two main forces in life that are an inescapable reality.
1. Division of labor - more hands make any work lighter
2. Economies of scale - production is cheaper when you have many hands working towards the same goal.

I'm not sure exactly how to proceed, but I think the most important thing at this juncture, is to ask whether this is a topic that we need to have in this group, and for that reason, I'd like to pause here for a moment and hear¬†your¬†thoughts.

Hi Cousin

Thank you for sparking this important conversation. I completely agree that while celebrating our family heritage is invaluable, we have the potential to evolve into a more resourceful and impactful group.

I appreciate the focus on those of us between 30 and 50, as we are at a pivotal point where we can leverage our experiences and resources effectively. The idea of moving beyond the traditional blueprint our parents followed is crucial. While their approach provided a solid foundation, our current environment requires us to adapt and expand our strategies.

The examples you provided of other communities working together and prioritizing internal support are inspiring. I believe we can learn a lot from them and create a similar support network within our family. This could involve sharing knowledge on financial literacy, investment strategies, and other areas where we can collectively benefit.

I'm fully on board with discussing how we can better support each other and create a sustainable, resourceful family network. Let's hear more thoughts from everyone and start brainstorming actionable steps¬†we¬†can¬†take.
