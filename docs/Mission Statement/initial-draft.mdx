# Initial Draft

:::info[Maina, Ng'ang'a]

2024-06-14

:::

It looks like we have a few 'yes' votes, and I think this should be enough to set the ball rolling. I'm hoping that more will join, but we have to lead by example, so that others may feel confident in opting in and speaking up.

First, I want to acknowledge the presence of our uncle @John Macharia whom I want to give a shout out for his wisdom and willingness to help guide this ship. We definitely need a voice with life experience to keep us honest with ourselves and also help us recalibrate our expectations before we veer off the track.

Next, I was writing up some notes to help steer conversations and hopefully serve as a launching pad for generating other ideas. So this is not the entirety of what we shall be doing in this group, but instead is a mental sketch of what my initial thoughts were. So you are highly encouraged to disagree, make suggestions and bring up any opinions. I also realize that we might need a more sophisticated way of taking notes and keeping them organized, so I will look into hosting a software platform for the group that we can leverage. Ok, here we go
